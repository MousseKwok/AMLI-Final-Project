Have returned to try out some of the other soups!\\nUpdate: The vegetable udon noodle soup was also very good. The ambience and decor need some work, but the service is very courteous and the soups are great.',\n",

       " \"I actually think that the place is a 3.5, so, I am rounding it up! I ordered the tonkotsu ramen anddd it was okay. Would I order it again? ehh, maybee. The boba tea wasn't very good, at first I thought it was okay but as I kept drinking it the taste just got a bit funky, probably wouldn't order it again. My sister got the curry chicken katsu, NOW THAT was delicious! highly recommend that one if you are going to Tokyo Cafe. Would I come back?  I think so. I like that it's in North Las Vegas close to my home and I don't have to go all the way to china town to get some ramen but, with that being said, I've been spoiled with Monta Ramen(NOW that place is absolutely delicious) too bad it's so far away.\\nI hope Tokyo Cafe stays though, I'll come back :)\",\n",

Clean with minimal, simple decor. We ordered seaweed salad, shrimp tempura, spicy shoyu ramen, and a chicken teriyaki bowl. The service was quick and the staff was very friendly. Even better, the food was delicious! Very generous portions. We left pleasantly full, and with leftovers to boot! We will definitely be back.\",\n",
       " \"Ramen here was awesome. We ordered two Tonkatsus with extra chashu and eggs and spicy broth, and it did not disappoint. It was $7.99 before adding the extras, which is a very fair price point considering we got two meals each out of our order. Service was efficient and the food was delicious. We'll be back when we're in town again!\",\n",

       " \"Hidden little gem if you're looking for an amazing Teriyaki bowl! Dont let the simplicity of the restaurant appearance fool you. I've been here twice and both times did not disappoint. I ordered both beef and shrimp bowls with a side of shrimp tempura.The beef is actually steak! The portion is large and prices are extremely reasonable. Everything is seasoned perfectly. The side salad is a perfect addition with a mouth watering ginger dressing. The tempura shrimp so yummy! better than many restaurants that charge double the price. Dont forget to scoop up a little side of pickled ginger and garlic puree sauce!\",\n",
       " \"First time eating Ramen besides the $.20 store bought ones, the food was very reasonably priced & you get a hearty serving. Of course I had to be greedy and add extra noodles to mine (big mistake!) I thought I was going to blow up! I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen spicy, but you can order inot spicy also. It was so full of flavor, the pork belly had an awkward taste to me but my husband & son thought it was good. The only negative about the place was the lady at the register. She literally had no personality! She seemed annoyed by us asking what some of the items were on the menu & at the time we were the only people there, so it's not like we were holding up the line? However the gentleman that brought out our food was very friendly. I'd definitely return, angry lady or not!\",\n",

The food is good and consistent. Ive had pretty much everything here - and let me tell you -- it's the best prices in town! The teriyaki is always juicy and fresh. The ramen is never mushy. The miso and shoyu ramen are super tasty. The veggies are fresh and crispy. The soba is to die for.  Both the cold and stir fried Yaki Soba are delicious. 1 order is enough for 2 people to share. \\n\\nService is friendly. Atmosphere is quiet and never too busy. \\n\\nThe one thing this place needs to improve on is their boba drinks. I've had both the Thai tea and milk tea - both of which is sugar overload. Drinks are premade and can not be adjusted. When asking for less sweet -- I was told it's not possible since it's premixed. Of you're looking for an authentic boba tea - look elsewhere. Their sugary drinks tastes like flavored milk with a ton of sweetener. But if you're in the mood for ramen or soba -- this is the go to spot!\",\n",
       " 'Really good broth. Tonkatsu is on point. It is not something that will blow your mind away but it is very good. Noodles were good and not overcooked as well as the boiled egg. Milk tea was also great.\\n\\nService is awesome and the people are polite and very nice.\\n\\nIm so glad there is a place like this in North las Vegas. \\n\\n\\nHad the spicy tonkatsu and it was sooooooo goooooooooood!!!!',\n",
       " \"Came to this place because the reviews were good, such a disappointment. Ordered the chicken teriyaki, sauce on the side, the plate comes flooded with sauce. Same with the beef teriyaki. The meat is dry, and tasteless, sauce taste like it's from the bottle. There's is nothing authentic about this place, except the bottled drinks they have. Will never be coming back!\",\n",
       " 'Phenomenal!\\nTry your Ramen (Tonkatsu for me) spicy, but only if you are REALLY ready for the heat. The Chicken Katsu curry was excellent, and portion size was more than generous. Tofu Katsu curry was just as tasty.\\nWhat it may lack in atmosphere, Tokyo Cafe is an incredible find. Perfect lunch or early dinner choice.',\n",

       " 'Great good very inexpensive! I had the pork katsu curry and my wife had chicken katsu curry both were excellent! We messed up and order a appetizer of edamame way to much food. Most everything here you could probably split there is so much food. We highly recommend you stop in here!',\n",
       " 'Authentic. No where else like it. Amazing charm and people. Reminds of Tokyo, which I miss everyday. This is the closest to Japanese food I have ever had here in the states.',\n",

       " \"Just found out about this place like 2 wks ago and have already went back a few times. The people are so nice who work there and you get a lot of food for your money.  I've tried the Chicken Yakisoba, Beef Teriyaki and their Fried Rice (with chicken and beef). All of them were AMAZING! They all tasted so fresh. The veggies they use are definitely fresh. The beef and chicken they use are good quality/ good cuts! They are not stingy at all with the meat! I don't have to wait long at all for it be ready. This is my new FAVORITE place to go.\",\n",

       " \"I come here all the time.  I'm honestly suprised they don't know me when I walk in yet lol.  I really  like the fried rice here.  All the different types are great. They have recently started letting you order it spicy.  They cook the spicy into it just the way I like it.  The Ramen is also very good, I haven't had Ramen at too many places in town yet, only three or four other restaurants but this place is right up there.  The portion sizes for the peice is crazy good.  You got so much food for a reasonable price.  The restaurant is clean.\",\n",
       " 'We drove by this place and very surprised their food is better than 5 star restaurants.  I have a new favorite place to go',\n",
       " \"One of my favorite spots near my house.  Fast service.  The ramen soups they have are really good and I prefer the tonkasu ramen even though the broth isn't as thick as it should be. The teriyaki plates are amazing so don't sleep on them big serving.  Cheap and affordable food.  Also if you get some ramen save the broth when your done with the noodles and ask for a noodle refill then boom! A whole bowl of ramen all over again. Not as good as other ramen shops in Vegas but it's probably the best your gonna find near nellis afb.  I do recommend! Go go go!!\",\n",

I just don't understand the 4.5 star rating? \\n\\nWe got the tonkatsu ramen and the pork tonkatsu curry. They were both good just nothing special. The cha shu in the ramen was really good just kinda thin and the soup was good too. The curry itself was good as well and surprisingly very spicy! I usually ask for spicy curry and it's just ok spicy but this was on fire. \\n\\nThis place is definitely worth a try especially since it's very well priced.\",\n",
       " \"Everything is made in house cooked to order and fresh. Very delicious. Will definitely be the place I go for ramen from now on. Fried rice and fried udon noodles were on point. You definitely must try when you are in the Vegas area. It's a little ways from the strip, but if you have a car, definitely worth the drive. Photos will come next time. Was too yummy I completely forgot to take them.\",\n",
       " \"I ordered tonkatsu ramen. It was okay, but just okay. The flavor was just off for me and the noodles not great. I had mango milk tea with boba but there was no actual tea in it but the boba were good so I'd probably come back for Thai tea with boba but that's it. I'm sad over this because it's so much closer than Monta but it can't compare. At all. Like, not at all. Sweet people though, very friendly.\",\n",
       " \"I went to this place with a few people today, had the taro milk boba tea and tofu katsu. The sauce was yummy and the boba tea is one of the best I've had.

       " 'Very good Japanese Ramen, especially for North Las Vegas. The Fried Gyoza are a solid appetizer. I really liked the dipping sauce. For the Ramen, I had both the Miso and the Tonkotsu. The Miso was good, but I definitely preferred the Tonkotsu, especially spicy. I wish I had ordered extra Chashu, it was very tasty.',\n",

My friend got the shrimp fried rice and there was only like 4 shrimp in it so she was a little disappointed but the flavor was there. I also got a watermelon boba and it was alright, I've had better. The ramen is a must have!\",\n",
       " \"My favorite item here is the cold soba noodle, which can be found on the tiny black chalkboard next to the register.  The dish comes with a generous portion of tempura shrimp and vegetables. Tempura is crunchy, the soba al dente. $7.99, well worth the price.\\n\\nThe only real complaint I have is the A/C is not that strong, so it's a little warm in there.  Seating is adequate, but they have heavy traffic from Nellis and the surrounding businesses.\",\n",
       " \"Their Thai iced tea is delish! I had their Chicken Teriyaki Bowl and it was good. They give lots and lots of rice! Guess they did away with the check-in edamame, because there wasn't any check-in goodness to be had.\",\n",

       " \"Great place. Got the cold sobs tempura. Came with a plate of cold soba with a broth to dip and another plate of shrimp and veg tempura with same broth. Broth wasn't too salty, the tempura was nice and warm/crispy but not over cooked. Noodles were great with a side of green onions and wasabi to add to the broth. All for $8!!!  Great lunch place.\",\n",
       " \"Had dinner here on a Tuesday night and it was real relaxed. The food was awesome! I got chicken curry katsu and it reminded me of Coco's curry which is a very popular place in Japan.

Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.\",\n",
       " \"Came here for lunch and had a strawberry boba with some miso ramen. The service was extremely fast, the ambiance was amazing, and the food tasted spectacular. My ramen noodles were cooked perfectly and although I asked for normal and not spicy, there was enough spice in the miso soup for taste, which was incredible. The strawberry boba itself was okay. The boba balls were very soft, not frozen, and were perfectly chewy, though the actual strawberry flavor tasted way too artificial and was essentially bubblegum pink/flavor instead of strawberry. I'm sure another flavor would've been better. \\n\\nAnyway, overall, this place is amazing and I definitely will recommend to friends and possibly bring some here too. Great service, great food.\",\n",

But, was still fulfilling for my teriyaki fix. The side salad was good, lightly dressed with a ginger vinaigrette. The appetizers I ordered were on point.

It's a nice quiet little cafe that seem to just open recently. Great place to get Thai tea or even ramune soda pop. Their customer service is definitely a plus. Really friendly and all smiles.

Awesome! The edamame came out to the table very quickly and was salted perfectly and tasted as they should. The Ramen also arrived shortly after and was then slurping away! The Miso broth tasted very different from the broths Ive had at china town and I liked it! It seemed to be a soy sauce based broth with miso and had that extra salty kick that was a welcomed combo, the ramen was very chewy and dense and had perfect texture! The chashu was awesome! Less fatty, tender, and Great flavor! Along with bamboo shoots, Nori, and the egg was such a great taste! Two bowls of ramen with two drinks for just about $20 even, Not bad at all considering the amount you get. Def a great addition to North Las Vegas as we needed a good ramen spot! So it surprised us so much that we got the tofu and chicken curry to go. As we just finished those dished, The curry was also a great dish! The tofu and chicken both has great crust and crunch, the rice was cooked well, and the vegetable were fresh, steamed goodness! The curry was not overpowering and complemented the tofu and chicken very well. I hope Tokyo Cafe the best and that they prosper as It will be def in my reg rotation of restaurants to go and eat at!',\n",

I found the levels (after we had ordered) on a handmade menu near the cash register.  Please update your main menu with curry spice levels and acquire some fukujinzuke, please.  I highly recommend Tokyo Cafe.  They also played good old school Japanese music (my wife knew all the lyrics).',\n",

Tempura was Krispy you could tell it was not store bought or frozen. To go we orders chicken fried rice. The rice didn't have much color to it, which in my opinion is good. I hate rice that has overwhelming soy sauce flavor. This rice was great. The chicken to rice ratio was great and the portions on their meals are a steal for the price they are charging.

My employees or I would come to pick up the order at the listed time of completion on the website and come to find out the order had not even got processed.

So today I decided to try and order again online, entered my order in at 2:45 pm, came to pick it up at 3:45, and the same issue with the food not being ready had occurred again (there was only one customer in line) In one hour a simple online order could not be processed!! I had to wait another 10 minutes for them to make the food. I spoke to the manager and she had no answer to why this problem keeps occurring after I told her this continuously happens when we order online.

       " 'I am new to Yelp and have used it on several instances for good advice on restaurants and just general good advice about businesses. Anyway I had a HORRIBLE experience with Tire Works!!!!! I bought a set of new tires for my Tacoma. Brand name Cooper A/T\\'s for my truck. Well when I had them installed I scheduled a time when I could get them installed. I dropped my truck off and it sat for 3 hours and never been touched!!!! Mind you I just spent $700 plus on freaking tires!!!! After talking to the store manager to hurry up because I had to go to work they finally installed my tires. At the time when my tires were installed I declined to have my alignment checked because I had to go to work and I talked to the manager I asked him if I could come by the following day to have it aligned and he said that would be ok. So the following day I had my truck aligned by them in and out pretty quick. Well after a few weeks I noticed my tires were cupping. So I took it back to Tire Works for either an alignment issue or faulty tires. After they looked at my truck they said my shocks were bad which I didn\\'t believe but I went ahead and replaced them myself and there was nothing wrong with my shocks on the truck. So I went back to tire works to get my tires warrantied with my new shocks and they told me I had to contact Mondona which is Tire Works warranty claims individual. Anyway after he hawing around and arguing with me she finally decided to warranty the tires NOT!!!! After I got off the phone with her I got a call from her boss and he told me that since I declined to have my tuck aligned when I purchased the tires my warranty was void even though I went back the following day after purchase and had the truck aligned. After that he insulted me and basically said I was an \"idiot\" for declining to get the alignment done that day!!!!!! Take my advice NEVER EVER go to Tire Works!!!!!!!!! I have gone to Discount Tires since I started driving and if you have an issue they fix it on the spot! The only reason I went to Tire Works was because I got a good deal \"or I though\" on the tires when I purchased them. DON\\'T DO IT TIRE WORKS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!!!!!',\n",

He even called me during the process and said if I wanted I could come down and take a look to make sure it was turning out as I envisioned. Oscar is a professional and perfectionist, he's an artist in his craft. He also testified them so that they were restored back to perfect like new. He's deep in north Las Vegas by an industrial area and his work is impeccable. We all love our newly refurbished and so comfortable sofas that we purchased 26 years ago.

This wasnt del tacos flavors at all.  Something unconventional was done to and with this food because it tasted so far from anything ive ever gotten from del taco.

The sauce bin is empty by the drink machine so I ask one of the guys that\\'s just standing around for some sauce.

Little does this Jack ass know that people like myself who choose to carry put a target on our backs every time we step out into public.

I shouldn\\'t have to wait 40 minutes for an incorrect order, drive home to find the mistakes, to bring it all the way back and deal with that type of attitude by the \"manager\".

Jazmine was a total sweetheart to me and listened to everything I said before touching the scissors. She gave me a fantastic haircut especially for someone who has never dealt with my hair.  I normally don't leave glowing reviews until I have seen a stylist twice.  Jazmine had a very calm demeanor which meant the world to a nervous person and before I knew it I felt calmer. She took my instructions and photos well and I would not hesitate to recommend her for someone who needs calming...lol and a nice haircut.\",\n",
       " 'Have had many great experiences every time I take my son here. \\nWould recommend coming here! \\nThanks for always taking care of us \\nGreat customer service at each visit.',\n",
       " 'I absolutely love this Supercuts and Jazmine. When I first came in and sat in her chair my hair was so butchered I was horrified and Jazmine was so kind and able to fix it that now I refuse to go anywhere else and see anyone else. She is so much fun to talk to while sitting in her chair and she definitely keeps it real.',\n",
       " 'First time to go this place and I was impressed. Place is clean. Hannah is good. She did exactly what I wanted for me hair. Will definitely come back.',\n",
       " \"This place is great, sometimes it does get packed so I would recommend setting up an appointment. Hanna is my favorite, I'll just show her the hair cut I want and she just makes it happen!\",\n",
       " \"It was a long wait, but it was well worth it because the ladies acknowledge the customers and mentioned that there was going to be a wait before signing in (and would also give a rough estimate of how long it would take). When it was finally my turn, I showed a picture of how I wanted my hair to look like. Morgan did such an excellent job on explaining to me exactly how it would look like on me and to why it looks a certain way on the picture. Because of this, it really made me think about the style I chose and I'm very glad she explained to me in detail how it would look like before cutting my hair off. So instead, without any pictures for reference, I asked about another cut and she showed me how she would be doing it. You can tell that she takes her time to perfect her work and does not rush at all, unlike some other stylists. She definitely knows what she's doing and I would highly recommend having her cut hair. $15 for a haircut isn't bad. I chopped off A LOT of hair.\",\n",
       " \"I never have to wait at this place. The online check in app has to be the smartest thing ever. Amy did a great job on my sons hair. He's always so picky and she just sat him down and took care of it. Had a 3:30 appt. came in at 3:15. Checking out now at 3:29!!!\\nThanks Amy!!\",\n",

Person on the phone offered to add me to the list(wait what!)and asked me to come in in 45 min, I walk in about 40min later and they are waiting on us(just perfect). I brought my son in for a normal haircut. Celia R took very good care of him. She called me over about three times to check in length and questions regarding cut. She's a true perfectionist and as a parent I appreciate it. She was not aggressive with haircut at all. She wanted to make sure all was well before I left and it was. I will definitely be returning.\",\n",

I keep going back to him every two weeks as being in the military is strict with hair. they do give military discount and do a great job. if you are a guy I would recommend tano. I will keep going here as long as they keep doing my hair correctly. a few place in the valley mess it up every time but this place is on point. highly recommend checking this place out, and get the app to check in, it makes it go by quicker for you and you shouldn't have to wait to long.\",\n",

       " 'This place has been on our list for a while now and we finally made our way over this weekend. As a small standalone restaurant next to an auto repair shop, the location is a little weird and only has a few parking spots, but it definitely is a hole-in-the-wall gem.\\n\\nIt has seating for maybe 20 people, but we were seated at a table for two without problem on a Friday evening. The menu is almost entirely ceviche, so if you like ceviche, you will love the number of options! I got the Cevipiña, which admittedly I ordered because it is so pretty, but it was yummy with raw shrimp and pineapple ceviche inside a pineapple. I got a margarita and the bf got the tomato-beer cocktail (he cannot remember what it is called, womp womp) that came filled with shrimp! The food was good, but the wait for that food was agony. We easily sat for 45 minutes for our raw dinners to be prepared. There was a larger party of perhaps 10 waiting on food before us, so this was likely the problem, but defintely a bit frustrating.\\n\\n\\nOverall, food was good. Prices were fair. Drink prices were exta fair ($6 margaritas!!!). Parking - limited. The menus were super sticky and falling apart and the place did feel like it needed a good cleaning - im usually not one to harp on that too kuch but this establishment serves raw fish so probably worth mentioning...regardless, we do plan to come back for more yummy ceviche!',\n",

Stick to seafood as burritos, quesadillas, tacos etc are very average and almost Americanized Mexican food. It's almost like Roberto's(which is not that great). It is good overall, but seafood yum! I've had molcajetes, siete mares, tostadas, micheladas etc all amazing!! Four stars as location is very small, parking is limited and we always have to park behind the building.

I can honestly say I have finally found my dental HOME. I had a emergency over the thanksgiving holiday with a different dentist and it did not go well so I decided to try Dr Lee at this office OMG. I'm so glad I found this office. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. The receptionist Claudia is very good in explaining insurance options and helping with financial issues of course its expensive any time you go to the dentist I also know from experience the longer you stay away the worse the outcome will be. I had a root canal and was in the office for a while. Dr Lee is very gentle and takes time with his patients. they were able to do the root canal and the crown at the same time. I do not have to go back to put the permanent crown on after two weeks. Dr Lee explains the entire procedure as he goes so you are well aware of what's happening.  So if you need a great Dentist and a wonderful staff I highly recommend this dentist you will have found your dental home also... Make sure you tell them you read my review on Skype I know you will be very satisfied... I won't be going anywhere else.

I had to make a return sometime in the pre-Christmas sales of \\'11. I went in, and asked about how the pricing for the return was being done, because it was listed in a very confusing manner. The associate who was assisting me, did not know the full answer and asked the customer service manager to assist (fine. not a problem, when you don\\'t have the proper answer). Here\\'s where my problem arrived - the manager was talking down to me and not even looking at the receipt was telling me \"oh, yeah; you are getting your money back\". Me \"That is not my question. I am asking about this particular charge showing under the return, I am confused about this.\" the Mgr in a very unpleasant tone \"Oh well what\\'s the problem? You\\'re getting your full refund back.\" and further commenting to such a point of making me feel that I was being stupid for daring to ask about something that is not very easy to follow to begin with! I was getting so pi**ed off, I returned my entire purchase to the store - and told them explicitly I would never shop in that place again. The manager\\'s reply, \"Well you are never going to find a better return policy, because we have the best one!\" I even had some Kohl\\'s cash rewards - which I gave to a customer at check out to use. The cashiers saw how visibly upset I was (my hands were shaking pretty bad, and my voice was shaking too), and I said that there is nothing that the company can do to make me want to step foot into ANY of their stores. The cashiers were even horrified at how I had been treated by the customer service department, and were very sincerely apologetic. I called the 800 number after it had happened, to mention how poorly I had been treated, and all I can say is - if this is how poorly I was treated - how many others are being treated the same way? The customer service at the 800 # was appalled to hear how I had been treated, and actually took the time to explain things in a very reasonable manner, and had made offers to come back to the storebut I declined them all. $10 off, 15% discount...seriously? No offense, but that\\'s the usual customer coupon deals. My reply (in a very nice manner) to the lady was if they could authorize $100 or more in store, credit, then maybe I would reconsider. She did not have that power to do so. I explained to the gal when a customer is put down so much by management or any other store rep to make them feel or think they are unintelligent because of a confusing way something is listed (and she even agreed the way items are displayed on receipts are very confusing) - you have effectively blocked them from wanting to shop with you at all. In being a yelper now, I figured I would let everyone else know about this horrid experience, and the lack of professional customer service at this location. I can only imagine if a manager will treat a customer this way the employees under this individual\\'s supervision will do the same or worse to other customers.',\n",
       " 'This review is about the LOUSY/ INCOMPETENT customer service I received while ordering my engagement ring on KOHLS.COM. This started on March 9, 2015. My mother agreed to order my engagement ring by request of my fiancee from Kohls.com while it was on sale so that we could get the wonderful sale price and he could just pay her for the ring. It was a 3000.00 Simply Vera Vera Wang on sale for 1050.00. What a deal, right?! Yeah, we thought so too. So my mom and I called, spoke to a rep named Jessica, who took the order, told us it was good to go and it would be in my mail between March 13-18. My fiancee and I checked the mail each day impatiently (because even after we get the ring, we have to take it into the Kohl\\'s store so they can then send it out to be sized so that\\'s more time that I have to WAIT for my ring). On March 16, I called into the customer service line since I never received a confirmation email or tracking number as was promised. I wait for 24mins before they answer the line and speak to Jennifer who informed my that our order was rejected. In shock, I ask why. She informs us that the idiot who placed our order put MY name on the billing address that matched my mom\\'s card. So even though my mom\\'s credit card company approved the charge, Kohls.com\\'s fraud department rejected it. Furious at this point, I ask why I wasn\\'t notified. No one knows. Great. So Jennifer gives me an additional 50.00 off the price and places my mom and I on hold while she cant figure out how to make the charge go through on my mom\\'s credit card. Then at the 59 minute mark, the call goes into the after call survey. She disconnected. And guess what? No call back. Perfect. I call again, speak to Kipp. He fills out all the info, takes 100.00 off for the inconvenience and got my mom\\'s approval to charge the card. He says all is good to go and I say great and ask for a supervisor. I then speak with Jim. I tell him about this awful experience and he says he will pull those calls to find out what happened and do some agent coaching, he\\'s so sorry, etc... Great. The next day, my gut tells me to call to check on this ring after all the hassle. Good thing I did, cause guess what?! It was REJECTED.. AGAIN! No one actually ever explained to us why this time either- just that it\\'s their procedure to verify since it\\'s a large amount of money. Ok, but then why did no one question it when we ordered it to begin with. Shouldn\\'t they just automatically send us over to fraud so we can clear it up right away instead of having to go through this mess? And how the HELL do they know who\\'s calling anyway?! Anyway, I get transferred to the fraud department where I am advised by Romero that he can ONLY talk to my mother and then his supervisor, John, who advised the same thing (And by the way- this is the ONLY consistency among the Kohls.com representatives). I ask him why she needs to confirm AGAIN that this is our order and he says there are no notes that she has called in to make this order. Are you kidding me?! She placed the initial order herself! Then she was on the line each and every single time we talked to these morons! I asked him to pull the call and he looks for it but their \\'systems sometimes cant find the calls\\' so I was out of luck until I could reach my mom. She calls me back and I call into the fraud number John provided me with and spoke to the most unprofessional, rude woman named Vanetta who refused to speak with me even though my mother was on the line. She continued to call her hon and speak over her and me and then talked about me in the 3rd person as if I wasn\\'t even on the line saying, \" I\\'m sorry I had to agitate your daughter and congratulations on the wedding.\"  We asked her for the corporate office phone # and she said she could find a # for us. My mom asked her who the CEO of Kohl\\'s is and she said she \\'didn\\'t know which one would answer.\"  So, she placed us on hold for 17 minutes while trying to figure it out. I Google search the CEO, found a name and number to that office in about one minute\\'s time. She FINALLY came back to us and still had no clue what she was talking about so we asked her if our order was good. She said yes the order was cleared \\'forever ago.\\' Forever ago?! NO. Forever ago would\\'ve been on March 9th when we ORDERED IT!! We asked her how soon we.can expect an email and she said 15mins. So we hang up with her and I call back into customer service and request a supervisor. I got Jim again- the same guy I talked to the night before. HE told me it had been cleared by fraud the day before. Huh. Then why did we just spend an hour and a half on the dang line with FRAUD?! HE said he was sorry and that he had no words. He told me he would call me to let me know when it was in fulfillment. He did. I called the next day to check. Then I found out the email address was wrong. Sigh. I had to have mom call in to change it, but today we find out it cant be changed so no email will EVER be sent. So, still no ring',\n",

I was so excited to hear that they were opening here in Vegas. Since I don't review off of one time I'm reviewing off of multiple visits to this location since they have opened. \\nMy first experience was not so great. (They made it right, right away too.) But every time since then has been amazing! Great staff and service, most of the time. The food isn't as always consistently the same but it's still delicious!! My favorites are the hashbrown casserole and chicken n' dumplings. My boyfriend got me to try the greens and I'm so glad he did tender and cooked to perfection.\",\n",

It was really good, however I'm not a huge fan of country gravy so I ate it with their brown gravy instead. \\nI started off with their vegetable beef soup and it was also really good.\",\n",
       " \"So happy Cracker Barrel is so close to our home. As always the food is good as are the prices.  I think  one thing I like so much about Old Cracker Barrel chain restaurants is I can shop in each one for unique items.   There are also cute home items. We never wait long for a booth or table. They have the best lemonade in my opinion. Service is always great.  Big huge selection of food special's.\",\n",

       " \"My husband and I stopped in this afternoon. It is a little confusing, the sign above the entrance to the restaurant said exit, then we noticed the menus on the stand. Once seated our server was right there and took our drink order. My husband decided to get the special of the day which was chicken pot pie. I ordered the chicken BLT. I looked at the pot pie as it was being served and the crust on top did not look like it was flakey or cooked. As my husband dug into it, he said he had 4 1/4 carrots 2 potatoes and a ton of peas. The gravy was just ok, no real flavor to it. He ordered biscuits for his side, which were dried out. As I stated, I ordered the Chicken BLT. The sourdough bread was barely toasted, the chicken looked burnt but actually tasted slightly rubbery, like it was microwaved. I had 2 pieces of cheddar cheese as advertised, however the cheese was not melted. I don't remember the menu stating the sandwich came with pickles although it had bread and butter pickles on it (I dislike bread and butter pickles). I had to cut the sandwich in half in order to try and eat it. Cutting it however, was a mistake. The bread not being toasted was getting near soggy and fell apart. I ended up eating a deconstructed sandwich. This is our second so-so experience at Cracker Barrel, I do not see us returning unless we have visitors who want to go.\",\n",

       " \"Super slow service and a few mixed up orders resulting from large number of customers lined up for the weekend, but you come to Cracker Barrel expecting this.  At least the lines in Vegas are shorter than in California. The poor wait staff and kitchen try to keep up but a lot of stuff gets mixed up. They should probably either increase their staff or slow down their seating so those customers that are served don't come away so disappointed.\\n\\nThe food is typical comfort food. Highly recommend the hash casserole (cheesy goodness), meatloaf, pancakes, and fried okra, but skip the cornbread if you like the traditional sweet flavor.  The biscuits were also pretty dry and since it was the only thing we had to eat for 20 minutes it was especially pronounced.  Wish we had saved room for dessert :(\",\n",

       " \"Horrible to go service. I had asked for the fancy fix in version of the sugar cured ham instead of the country dinner plate and we argued for 5 minutes that that didn't exist. I used to work at Cracker Barrel and that is definitely an option. I decided to just pay extra for a side and give up on the argument. I asked for my green beans as the extra side separate from the plate because it makes the rest of the meal soggy. When I finally got my hotel my meal was completely soggy with the green beans everywhere. As well the meat was so hard I had trouble cutting it and it was literally dripping in mixed juices. Very disappointed with my to go meal.\",\n",

I finally gave in  and boy I'm glad that I did. What an experience, first you walk into the restaurant down a porch with rocking chairs for sale. Upon entering the place it's a general store with all kinds of country things for sale. Cute, cute, cute. The front end person takes you inside the restaurant which is colorfully decorated with old-timey antiques and signs like frim the show American Pickers.  \\nAnyway, our server Zachary was pleasant and informative. We went with the fish N chips and the chicken salad. Everything was prepared fast and hot. We even tried the biscuits and they were fluffy and perfect.\\nI'm a foodie and this place has good food. The prices are reasonable also. I'm glad that I took a chance on this place. Next time I will post pictures..\",\n",
       " \"When this place first opened I'd give it 4 stars. But when I went a few nights ago I could barely give it 2\\nWhen we first arrived: hostess was polite,I asked for a table for 7, the hostess only saw my 3 children and I and asked me if the rest of my party was there. I told her one is and 2 are on their way. She asked how far they were,I said litterslly a few minutes. She was very hesitant to seat us,luckily the rest of our party arrived right then. Hmm weird,it's a Thursday night ,not busy at all yet they didn't want to seat us till our full party arrived. It was not a big deal because we were seated but being g I had 3 kids under the age of 11 w me,if we weren't seated right away when tables were available it would be an issue.\\n  Once sat our drink order was quickly taken.  About 15 minutes later our dinner orders were taken. Our driveway is came out right after. All but 1 drink came out and 1 drink order was wrong. Several minutes Utes later it was corrected. \\n We skipped on aps, 2 people I our party got soup/salad. It took about 20 mins for those to arrive. We waited about another 15 to 20 mins Utes and out came a basket w corn bread and biscuits. There was 7 of us. 1 corn bread,2 biscuits...not even enough for us to each have half. I couldn't find out waiter so I asked a different waitress and she Glady brought out a full basket. Here comes dinner...\\nThey brought out everyone's dinners except my 7 year old sons. Right away I said something.10 more minutes Utes went by. My son was getting cranky bc he was super hungry,my food was now cold bc I refuse to eat while my son doesn't. I had to leave the table and hunt down our waiter,who once again was no where I. Sight so I approached the manager. As I start to talk to the manager out cones our waiter,he looks at me and says...your waiting for the chicken fingers right? So I replied yes,I'm waiting for my son's chicken fingers. He said they will be right out.\\n3 minutes and his 2 chicken fingers and fruit came out.  Now that I can finally eat,I took one bite of my ham and couldn't do it. Cold,hard,thin ham that tasted just like SALT . MY account n cheese was great and my sweet potato casserole had a weird after taste .\\n A few of us ordered desert,our waited now had an aditude when I asked if the kids can have whip on their ice cream. Desert came out no whip on their ice cream and my uncle's apple pie was forgotten,and finally brought out when all other deserts were done. \\nSadly this experience will make me not return here. I believe that children's meals should ALWAYS be brought out first. If the chicken wasn't ready or they forgot his chicken fingers,then offer the Lil boy a bowl of fruit,or sonerhing. We were not discounted anything after this experience either. Not that we expected that but we would have left w a better taste in our mouths if even they acted like they cared. For a family restraint this place is missing g the mark\",\n",

My friend that I came here for breakfast and let me tell you it didn't disappoint. The service here what Space our server was on top of it she was finally she suggested so many things for us to eat and she always kept up with refill and making sure that everything was good. With  that being said let's get to the food I had the cinnamon French toast combo with the smoked pork sausage and scrambled eggs. It was heaven I have to say if I can describe it that would be the word! Cinnamon toast wasn't too sweet it was just right and the pork smoked sausage I've never had that before like that and it was the licious I wish I could've bought some oahu with me. My friend ordered the cheesy hashbrowns which was also delicious. We told the server that we are from Hawaii and she was so nice to give us a free order of cinnamon rolls biscuits which is kind of like a scone which was also delicious the overall feel of the place I just loved it. We were going to try and come back for dinner but we didn't make it back in time. The prices here are really good and you get a lot of food we actually had  leftovers to take back to the hotel.

It wasn't broken before so why change to fix it. Foil wrapped meals was better than this new way. Never again unfortunately. I ate only half and didn't want to keep eating. Next was the service. The staff is usually good however we got someone new and I had to ask for refills because she would never offer and she was way to worried about clearing the table to push us out instead of waiting for us to be done. She needs training on how to provide customer service because she shouldn't be trying to turn over tables if the guests are still eating it's just unprofessional.\",\n",

Same answer:  a biscuit (about as unhealthy as it gets...), extra gravy (not veg).

It was totally good for a mid road trip breakfast and getting to pick up a souvenir or two from the Country Shop was fun, too.\",\n",

Would suggest gas logs, which would be cheaper than fire wood and we would not smell like smoke for the rest of the day.

       " \"Very disappointed with this location. Small portions unhelpful management, and lack of organization. Out of all the Cracker Barrel restaurants I've been to this is the worst. Four people on a Saturday afternoon, restaurant wasn't too busy but it took over half an hour for a table. Peeking into the restaurant area, it looked like no body had bussed the tables so we couldn't be seated. Our food came out separately so some of us had food while the others had wait and just eat the undercooked biscuits. Not good! I usually order the sampler, my order came with the tiniest portion of meatloaf I've ever seen, imagine a slice so thin you can see the plate though it! In addition the ham was also small as well as dried out and chewy. I asked our waiter if this was the standard size and explained my ham was a little dry, he agreed it looked a little smaller than usual, called over the manager who said she agreed the portion was ridiculously small. They take my entree and within a few minutes came back with what looks like a different plate with an extra side. Manager winked at me and left. Upon closer inspection I was in disbelief, it was the same meatloaf and same ham steak! You could see they microwaved it because the anorexic looking meatloaf was now sizzling and the ham was even darker and had turned to jerky! The only thing they changed was adding more dumplings and another side. At this point, I'd lost my appetite. Ended up going to McDonald's to fill up on the dollar menu. I'm taking a trip up to Utah for the better location. Just because this place is closer, didn't make it better.\",\n",

       " \"This review is for the Craig/ North las Vegas location. I have to say I had my doubts after reading a lot of bad reviews online but my husband and I were really excited to check this restaurant since we had never tried it before. We went there on Thursday around 8:30 am and no wainting time at all, walked directly to our table. We even didn't like the first table they gave us and asked for a window table and they said it was ok. The restaurant was not full yet, around 9 am we saw more people coming in but at that time we were enjoying our delicious food. \\n\\nok. the food. We didn't know what to order because we wanted to try everything!!! My husband ordered the old grandpa breakfast or something like that, it was a fried steak with gravy of course, hashbrown, biscuits, gritts and a side of 2 buttermilk pancakes. Everything was delicious, not cold like I had read in previews reviews. I had the yogurt, eggs, turkey bacon and blueberry muffin. Again no complaints. the coffee was not so hot but mine was deccaff so I can't talk about the regular one. Good service. As soon as we were seated the waiter came to take our drinks order and soon after our food order. food took a little long to come but no super long. They were refilling our mugs frequently and asking if we needed anything else and taking plates away. Never had to ask for a waiter. they were very helpful. overall great experience. we will be back for sure.\",\n",
       " 'Alright you guys. If you haven\\'t been here yet, go check it out. I\\'ve had a lot of complaints when I was working here so I found different employment but I\\'m not going to bash anything about them on here. The food is very good, depending on what you get. I was born and raised in Vegas and I\\'ve heard of Cracker Barrel but never expierenced the food or the \"southern comfort\" as we called it. This location first opened up back in October of 2016 and the food has come a LONG way since then. Our cooks have become more defined with their skills and our servers have gotten a lot better with the menu choices and how to treat our guests, you guys.! Of course I understand all of you guys are used to other Cracker Barrel\\'s across the United States and call yourself \"experts\" but you probably don\\'t remember what it was like when a chain FIRST opened up. That\\'s what you had to do for our 2815 E. Craig Road location. When I left, as far as I was aware of, we were the ONLY store to do the Online Check In and yes it was not only a beta test but a hassle all the way around. But just like anything that is a beta test, it takes time to get to know and understand the system. Ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a problem, speak up and say something to the server or cashier that is assisting you.. Our job is to correct your expierence so you WANT to come back. If you don\\'t want to talk to us and tell us what\\'s going on because you have a bone to pick with us, at least tell us so we can get a manager involved so they can do something to help you. How are we supposed to give you that Southern Hospitality like our sister stores if you don\\'t communicate with us..? Our Silverton location has been opened since July of 2016, so not much longer than us. And we even heard from guests that they didn\\'t like their food when they first opened.! Just give us a chance and communicate with us. We want you to come back and to tell your friends about us.',\n",

I was raised in the deep south, and \"I\" know Southern cooking and flavors. It might fool these local Westerners, but this is horrible food preparation (seasoning). The only item that tasted descent was the breaded fried Okra, the Turnip Greens were a joke; horrible flavoring. I cook and prepare Turnip & Collard greens with some real Southern Style and great taste, here in my own home of Las Vegas. Famous Dave\\'s across the street has great tasting cornbread, yours has no taste and are hard as can be. Sorry Cracker Barrel, you get 1 star. Shouldn\\'t even get that.',\n",

Then I noticed that people who came in after me, were getting their food, finally after about 30 minutes or more, I went and got the manager, because, the waitress was useless, she did not even come fill our drinks, while we were waiting. I told the manager what was happening. And he started yelling at me, and pulled an attitude. He said all the right things, be they were said in a condescending manner, and stomped off to see what was wrong. He kept saying,\" I am sorry, we are only human, your ticket got lost do you want me to pay for your food?\" Again, in a very nasty way. All the customers sitting around us, heard this exchange, and all agreed with me, that I was right, and they would have done the same thing. They all said, yea, we saw you here, as they were seating us, so we know what you are saying is true. I know stuff happens, but to be treated like it was my fault, is wrong. The waitress should have been on top of it, but she wasn\\'t. So these two, should not be in the customer service business, I have worked in the customer service business for over 40 years, you do not treat the customer like this, when all I did was order food. Which, by the way, is just mediocre coffee shop food, it is nothing special. This dinner plate they advertise,  is actually a child size, so if you are not very hungry, that is the one. But I do not recommend this place at all.',\n",

Officially the servers should bus, clear and clean their own tables for that matter. They had crappy pay with a debit card instead of a written paper check. Managers throwing and slamming materials in the dish area when their not supposed to. Small food portions should be upgraded to a more satisfying and average amount. This location really doesn't deserve 3 stars. 2 stars at the most..The kitchen was always filthy. Trash and spills all over the floor, coffee cups having stains and lips prints all over. Kitchen bathroom looking nasty. One of the managers went in to take a dump and left their poop smeared inside the toilet bowl. I always made sure I went to the bathroom at home where it's mostly safe. If this Cracker Barrel had a better industry and staff I would of stayed at least up till 4 or 5 years. Right now this Cracker Barrel needs some serious help.\",\n",

I do feel the sides were slightly smaller than they should be. Especially my friends dish where she got the fish and she chose seasonal fruit as one of her sides and she got three strawberries and three chunks of pineapple. As for my food the only thing that did not live up to expectations was the fried apples which did not have much flavor at all. The service was mediocre.

       " \"In the Las Vegas area there are currently two Cracker Barrel locations. One is on the southwest of the city and the other is on the north and this is the one on the north side (which opened only 2 months ago). I stopped for lunch on the 1st of January. It was around noon and the place was insanely packed. It was also loud. I have been at many Cracker Barrel locations across the nation and I have never seen so much people in line to eat. I put my name in the list and 45 minutes later I heard my name being called. At that point I was taken to a table and I was assisted by Jason. I ordered a frozen apple cider mug and farm-raised catfish platter with three sides: turnip greens, vegetable of the day (cabbage) and fried apples. I also got a biscuit and a corn bread. The frozen apple cider mug was out of this world. I have been at this restaurant many times and I never tried it. I feel so guilty with myself. I will spend the rest of the year accusing myself. I was surprised how good the mug was. Basically, it was a dense apple juice, something like a liquid version of an apple sauce. It was juicy and sweet. I will definitely order it again. The fried catfish consisted of two pieces of breaded catfish which I found very tasty. The turnip greens are something I never tried before. It was similar to spinach but raw in texture. The cabbage was good. I had it before but it was cooked differently. This time it was served as moderately wet leaves. The fried apples were great, sweet and flavorful. It's unfortunate that I looked a jar of that and I found out it contains high-fructose corn syrup (very disappointing indeed). Jason was great at the table. He was friendly, helpful and polite. I enjoyed talking to him. After a while we lost him a little (he seemed busy or not around so much). It was another great meal at the Cracker Barrel. This place deserve no less than 4 or 5 stars. Cracker Barrel is still my all-time favourite restaurant. What a fantastic place to eat meals!\",\n",

In particular we have got to know a Zack one of the morning waiters. Zack is both professional and friendly, makes you feel very comfortable.

Not quite ready to give it a 5 star but happy to see it improving.\",\n",

       " \"Usually this chain is good from what I've experienced in other states and locations. However this one usually forgets to bring you things you ask for like coffee or hash browns. They resolve when you remind them once they make it back around to your table. Today was no different, went in with family and tried the pork chop, came out cold and so hard and dry it was not chewable. I thought it was a joke. I had my wife try it just to confirm. Tasted like it was over cooked hours ago and set aside. After wife told waiter and they offered another I didn't want it. Manager came over and took $3 off my meal for it since I ate the side which came with the meal. I've only done this twice before in my life and both times at different restaurants they would not charge me for the meal. Wasn't about the money as much as the gesture. Like $3 off will make us want to return. Not happening. That's the resolve on the management level. Sad.\",\n",

The biscuits were undercooked.  So why the 5 stars?  It's the professionalism the cashier and manager showed us when we commented about our experience.  They both acknowledged that they needed to improve and welcomed our feedback. A lot of corporations will say they welcome negative feedback so they can improve but that's not always the case.

AFter several interactions with the host, and watching many other groups be taken back, we were finally seated after almost an hour. Service was terrible. Got drinks, but no bread until right before we finally got our food. THe cornbread muffins were no where near as good as I had previously, in fact they wer even a bit hard from being overcooked. The biscuits were not very good either. My mom ordered a shrimp dish and they only gave her one lemon. so we finally tracked down a manager going by, and asked for more. We watched as he went around helping many other tables, and clearly forgot our lemons. BYt he second request, we now needed refills on our water.

In addition, The wait time for our food was also long and noticed another couple get up and leave disgusted because of the wait time. The only positive was the waiter who was being trained was very nice and tried.

He asked for his bacon extra crispy and was not satisfied with what was provided and promptly requested to send it back. The server was very nice and accommodating.

I took an order in and there was a claim that they called our office to let us know that there was a copyright issue.  She claimed that we hung up  on her what she doesn't realize is the number we gave office depot was our answering service no one would have hung up on her.  They also record callers and there was no evidence that office depot called.  When I came to pick up the order I spoke to another manager who said that if I brought a letter back they would accept the order.  I came back with the letter and again the order was not run - this was from a totally different person and acknowledged as a valid reason but nobody called us to let us know there was a problem - that being copies made from the original would not copy well, they needed the file.  I brought a thumb drive with the file last Friday and was told by the same person that failed to call us and failed to let us know there was a copying problem that she wasn't working the weekend but give her to Monday.  I gave her until Wednesday (yesterday 10/20/16) and it still wasn't run and the electronic file that I had brought by last Friday was deleted.  This person said she would run the order and it would be ready in the afternoon.  I picked them up and took them back to work only to find out that the size was not cut properly even though the person that wrote it up said (cut to size of original) - the copies were for DVD covers so they had to be cut properly.  When I went back again, my favorite representative was back and was a blessing in disguise.  The Customer Service Manager said she would personally run the order for me and I was very sad to hear that her last day would be Saturday (10/22/2016) and she would be moving to another store.  The person that had been handling my copies had been promoted over other people, which is very surprising based on what I had seen recently.  The 2 people that I met with yesterday afternoon (after 4:00 pm) were the only reason why I was coming back to begin with and they have lost a bigger project because my boss no longer believes that this Office Depot is competent.  I will only leave copies when I know that my favorite representative is working.  The Craig Office Depot is convenient to where I live and work - what a shame that they are losing work because of certain people.  Based on my having to bring the project back 3 times I will barely give them a 1.  If we base it on the 2 people I met with yesterday (after 4:00 pm) they would have been given a 5.\",\n",

The staff was really friendly even though we was a bit late, they still made it work I definitely recommend this for some one trying to have a different experience while you are there.',\n",
       " 'My boyfriend and I did this tour last night and loved it. It had an amazing view and everyone who worked there were super nice. I wish the tour was a little longer, but it just means next time we will be taking the red rock tour. I would definitely recommend this to everyone! So worth the money, it is a great experience.',\n",
       " \"Found 702 Helicopter on Groupon, purchased the 15 minute Las Vegas strip tour. My boyfriend & I took flight September 16th around 8pm. SO GLAD WE DECIDED TO DO A NIGHT TOUR! The view was absolutely breath taking! Our pilot was amazing & made our experience that much better! He pointed out certain landmarks & held a conversation through the flight that made us feel extremely welcomed. Didn't want it to end! The ground crew were all very knowledgeable and made sure to answer all of our questions with a smile. We also got to tour the Hangar & see some awesome aircrafts! Would definitely recommend them any day! My boyfriend & I will return every time we are in Vegas. It's great getting what you pay for, but even better when the people working actually enjoy their job & treat you more like family rather than customers! Thank you to everyone at 702 for the wonderful experience!\",\n",
       " 'My husband who was not completely on board to be in the air as I found out after our ride, was completely amazed with the whole experience, he would absolutely do it again, as I will, it was AWESOME!! The entire staff at 703 Helicopter were very hospitable from the person I spoke to over the phone to confirm our reservation, to the pilot. \\nThank you 702 Helicopter, look forward to our next ride.',\n",
       " \"Brian, the owner was our pilot and he was great. Super nice guy. We are locals, and he even showed us some stuff over the strip that we didn't know about. It was really cool. Clean facility. GREAT EXPERIENCE. Priceless, just pay the money and do this, you won't regret it.\",\n",
       " 'Brought Groupon last Tue and made appointment for Sat night to surprise my Mom and Niece and we all loved it!!!  John the pilot and the guy in the office forgot his name but man they were cute!!! and extremely nice.  The view was amazing just wish I could afford to be in it for a lot longer.  We are all still talking about it.  I would recommend it to anyone that goes to Vegas.',\n",

Light batter fried chicken tenders and delicious thin crinkled fries. If that's not your thing, don't bother.  Most (disclaimer No.1) people who like fried chicken strips, really really like Cane's and then there is everybody else.\\n\\nWhen you order there is going to be a wait because they prepare your food at that time. Nine times out of ten (disclaimer No.2) it's presented to you hot so be careful for the sake of your mouth. \\n\\nServed with a thick piece of Texas toast - light crunch on the outside and soft in the middle. Order the 4 piece strips and you get coleslaw to boot. \\n\\nPlenty of seating inside and a drive-thru for the grab and go crowd.

I can't jump on the trendy 5 star bandwagon just because the \"cool kids\" are doing it. So here's my review based on an honest experience for this location. \\n\\nIf I were rating the donuts alone it'd be an easy 4-5 stars. The major problem I encountered was the lack of professionalism I received from the current manager, Jennifer. You'd think it would be that my order was messed up which caused disappointment, but the extreme lack of customer service spoke volumes. Even with the donuts tasting good it's not enough to bring me back to this location as long as the current manager is representing the business. \\n\\nA dozen of Classic Donuts is around $15 and it comes with the \"ultimate bakers special\" giving you 2 extra donuts and that's actually a good deal. The price gets painful when you want a dozen of their Gourmet Donuts that cost $24. Even with the bakers special giving you 2 extra donuts the price is still too high up there for donuts.\\n\\nI came in and placed my order in person and Jennifer assured me I would have vegan donuts with my order and that they would have 2 kinds. When we arrived to pay for and pick up the donuts, I noticed 2 were missing. She shrugged her shoulders and said \"I don't know\" then said we could buy the 2 that were missing. Huh? I already paid for 2 and a half dozen donuts and you are screwing me out of 2 and now you want me to pay for them? In her display case she had 2 kinds of vegan donuts yet we only had one kind with our order. Jennifer said I'd have to pay $3 to get the 2 vegan donuts with glaze on them. WTF?!?! I paid it, with frustration. I spoke with one of the co-owners Wayne a day later and he said he was very upset at the way Jennifer handled things and he offered me a partial refund, which I kindly declined. What Wayne can do to compensate me is simply have people who give a fuck working. It's seriously not hard to box up donuts. It's not like 5 people walk in wanting a burger cooked different ways with various toppings, we are just talking about donuts. \\n\\nThe donuts were well liked by most in my group. We ended up having plenty of choices and Jennifer cut up the donuts in pieces so everyone in my group had an opportunity to try several flavors without getting too full off one donut, even though she was reluctant at first. Jennifer mentioned cutting up pieces of donuts for people at the San Genaro Feast to try samples of, so I asked if she could do the same and she had the effing nerve to ask if I had utensils in my purse. WTF WTF WTF??? I might have a Mary Poppins bag from time to time, but damn I can't pull plates, napkins and utensils out of my purse on demand. I personally love the I Dream of Reese's donut the best! That Apple Fritter is a close contender though let me tell you it's good. They've got some creative flavors and Jennifer said a lot of it was still the recipe from the original owner Wayne, who's co-owner now. I can tell you that with certain donuts you'll have Pink Box Donuts flashbacks which makes a lot of sense if you are familiar with the history of Donut Mania. The donuts here really are good and I personally believe it's a kink in the staff at the moment. I've had donuts recently from their Durango location and everything right down to awesome customer service from Kevin and donuts that were on point was what I experienced. They have Peet's Coffee, but you'll have to wait on cold beverages because Jennifer showed me they have cans of soda and water for the employees in the fridge now. The donuts are currently being made at the Durango location and brought over in the mornings. Apparently they plan on putting in a fryer and making the donuts fresh here soon. We need a good donut shop in the area, so I am actually hoping for this place to do better.\\n\\nUPDATE: The response from Steven L was expected and of course full of cover-ups. I absolutely did go through their main marketing team speaking with even one of the co-owners Wayne. I have saved text msg's and emails that date right up to the day my group and I were set to come here saying \"it's all handled including your vegan order\" which we ended up NOT getting our correct vegan order. No exaggeration here all facts that I am totally willing to say in court. Yes, it's clear Jennifer has her friends and family coming on here posting fake 5 star reviews and trash talking what I said in my review showing they are completely unprofessional and lack manners yet you say she's one of your best employees who's allowed to have a bad day and I say that is just not acceptable. I can't turn over my hard earned money to a business that operates this way. Ever. The End.</th>\n",

       "      <th>Popcorn Girl is a great addition to this part of town. It's in the Walmart (near Cugino's and Salted Malted) shopping center. I've been by more than once and am always welcomed with a friendly greeting when I enter the store by the employees. They will let you sample anything on the menu, so don't be afraid to ask. Some of the flavors like Strawberry Cheesecake or Lemon Meringue don't sound so great in a popcorn flavor, but trying a sample of some of these not so common popcorn flavors will let you know if you would like it and would actually buy it for yourself or someone else that you think might like it. I tried the Lemon Meringue and was surprised at how good it was! I'd have never bought any in the future had I not just tried it. \\n\\nThey have popcorn in bags, tins, pails, etc. and it comes in a variety of sizes:\\nMini - 3 cups\\nJunior - 6 cups\\nSmall - 9 cups\\nMedium - 26 cups\\nLarge - 42 cups\\nX-Large - 110 cups\\nParty - 275 cups\\n\\nPrices range depending on what type of popcorn you want. Looking at the menu I noticed they have about 60 different flavors to choose from. You can get 3 cups of cheese popcorn for $1.95 and not only do they make the popcorn in-house, but they use real cheese. When it comes to the caramel corn the caramel is made from scratch with a secret recipe. Also they have kettle corn and a variety of candied and chocolate popcorn. I personally really liked the Strawberry Patch flavor, it tasted like crunch berries, yum! They also make homemade fudge in different flavors and they have taffy. A great and affordable place to stop and pick up a snack for yourself or a gift for someone else. I'll be back often!</th>\n",

       "      <th>I usually stop at CVS if I need a prescription filled or if I see a good deal from the weekly ad. Recently I was in need of some sugar-free hard candies and when I walked in the cashier greeted me right away. I asked her about the candies and she gladly pointed me in the right direction. They have a rewards program called \"ExtraCare\" that is worth signing up for even if you don't visit CVS often. Don't forget to scan your card at the coupon center to see what deals are going on and some might be specific to you based on your previous purchases. The more you spend at CVS the more you get back and save, but even if you are like me and only use it every now and then, you can still save on whatever deals are going on when you do visit as some items are way overpriced without it. Inside this location is clean and well stocked. The cashiers are for the most part friendly and helpful. The pharmacy definitely has some communication and customer service issues. I have stopped in to fill prescriptions before and been told that they would call or text me when I could pick them up. I'm used to being told what time the prescription will be ready and just showing up at that time, but now they have this new system where they say I will get a call or text when I can be there to get it, but they failed on this with me twice now. After most of the day passing and wondering why it was taking so long to hear from the pharmacy, I decided to call and check on things. Both times the prescription was ready to be picked up when I called. When I asked the guy at the pharmacy while picking up why they didn't call, he said that he forgot to send it in the computer. Not cool when people are waiting on medication to get better. They do have a Minute Clinic at this location to the right of the pharmacy, but make sure and call to check the hours it's open because it varies.</th>\n",

On my first visit the employees were friendly, helpful and got my order to me in a fair amount of time. The second visit I was the only customer yet it took a frustratingly long time to get my order and there were 3 employees working that seemed to care more about talking to each other. The prices are not bad for being inside a casino and the food court area offers a good amount of seating. \\n\\nI've never been a huge fan of Nathan's hot dogs. The best one I ever had was surprisingly from the snack bar at the drive-in on Carey. The bun on the hot dog I had at this Aliante location was nice and soft, but I didn't care for the taste of the hot dog itself or the watery/soupy chili. I could only eat a couple bites and was done. The chili was just not good and certainly not \"famous\" if you ask my tastebuds. One thing my tastebuds did like was the Crinkle-Cut Cheese Fries I've now had a couple times. The fries were perfectly crisp and there was a fair amount of liquid gold on top that not only tasted great, but didn't make the fries soggy at all. You can get a good sized portion of cheese fries for around $3 with tax and they have draft beer for $2 to complete your meal which is very reasonable given the location. They also currently have a promotion for a draft beer and hot dog for $5. I'll pass on the hot dogs in the future however will stop by at times for cheese fries.</th>\n",

This is the first stand-alone Capriotti's in town, so no strip-mall type scene here. It's in a small parking lot that's shared with Carl's Jr and conveniently located right across the street from Aliante aka Dinosaur Park which is a plus for those wanting to grab a sandwich before heading to the park. I was happy to be their very first customer the day they opened and to thank me for being first in line I was given any meal free! I've been eating at Capriotti's since they were a smaller business long before they were bought and then opened locations all over the country, so this free meal was well deserved and absolutely much appreciated! \\n\\nSmall - 9 inches\\nMedium - 12 inches\\nLarge - 20 inches \\n\\nCapastrami ($8.49 for the small) - Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw. I like several of the sandwiches on Cap's menu, but the Capastrami is my favorite. I have been to this location more than once since it opened and the sandwiches has been consistent. The coleslaw tasted fresh as well the bread that is baked by a local bakery here in town. \\n\\nI love the size of this Cap's it's spacious inside with plenty of seating and there is a bathroom. The ordering area is by far more spacious than any of the other locations currently in town and there is a sign that indicates where to pick up to-go orders so you don't have to wait in the regular ordering line. Outside they have specially marked parking for to-go customers. Another thing about outside is the dining area that is not only spacious, but dog friendly! I have eaten inside as well placed phone orders and the employees were courteous and polite and my order was ready when promised. I have been able to earn and redeem my CAPAddicts rewards here with no problem.</th>\n",

       "      <th>This location is in a strip mall and parking can be tight if it's Wednesday. Roberto's is a hole in the wall taco joint that's to most of us locals only acceptable food after a late night of drinking, but it's worn on me in the last year-ish when Wednesday rolls around and chicken tacos that are regularly priced at $2.35 are only $.99 cents and a limit of 12 per customer. There is no drive-thru at this location and it gets really busy, so wait times (usually on Wednesday) can be 30 minutes, no joke. People are all loading up on chicken tacos and it looks like they only fit about 12-14 in each basket of the fryer at a time. At least you know it's fresh!\\n\\nChicken Tacos ($2.35 regularly and $.99 cents on Wednesday) - The chicken tacos are fried and come with shredded chicken, cheddar and cotija cheese with lettuce inside. They are greasy and good. The chicken has a good flavor and you can't beat the price. I wish they were consistent at this location with the tacos. Sometimes they are overloaded with chicken and cheese (yay!) and sometimes they are skimpy. You can ask for the taco to be modified, but if it's Wednesday when the line is to the door you just might get a funny eye from the person taking your order lol. My hubby had the nerve once to ask for no lettuce on his tacos and will not make that mistake again! \\n\\nCheese Quesadilla ($2.85) - I appreciate that 'berto's offers a really tasty quesadilla at a fair price. Some places really overcharge for something so simple. Here they use a huge flour tortilla and a good amount of cheese that actually tastes good. \\n\\n3 Rolled Tacos ($2.35) - You can choose chicken or beef, I usually pick beef. They roll up the meat in a corn tortilla, fry it and cover it with 2 types of cheese. If you want guacamole with the cheese on top it's $3.50. I don't like the guacamole here, so I ask them to substitute the guac for sour cream.\\n\\nBean and Cheese Burrito ($2.85) - Priced right and huge! Problem is the beans are totally hit and miss. They put a good amount of freshly grated cheddar cheese inside, but the beans are not always consistent when it comes to flavor and texture. \\n\\nFYI if you want to add sour cream, cheese or guacamole to anything it's $1.10 extra. Inside has a good amount of tables and there is a bathroom.</th>\n",

       "      <th>Tsp. Baking Co is a nice addition to our neighborhood and opened by Kari, former co-owner of Retro Bakery. Serving mini cupcakes, cookies from scratch, ice cream sandwiches using Lappert's ice cream, fairy and cinnamon rolls as well mini cream pies, this bakery makes for one sweet stop that's well worth it. \\n\\nMini Cupcakes ($2 each or $20 a dozen) - I've tried a good variety of the mini cupcake flavors in the case and some I've really liked while other flavor combos didn't work for me. Firstly, these mini bites are just that, a bite. $2 is too expensive for just a bite. I'll treat myself to 2-4 minis every now and then because there are a few standout flavors I really do like, but I do cake decorating as a hobby and know that quality ingredients can still be used with a price tag that's better on the wallet than $2 a bite. One fun thing is their \"mystery flavor\" that changes often. If you can guess what the mystery mini cupcake is, it's yours free! I really like the Beanie mini cupcake that comes topped with an espresso bean. Any of the mini cupcake flavors can be made into a personalized cake with enough notice. \\n\\nCookies ($2 each or $18 a dozen) - There's a good variety of cookies daily in the case and really the main reason to come here in my opinion. The cookies are good in size, not too thin, not to thick and they aren't greedy when it comes the the amount of chips and or nuts some of them have. The peanut butter cookie is effing delicious! Frosted Cinnamon is popular in my house also, but it's the Mega Chip that has milk chocolate, white chocolate, peanut butter and butterscotch chips in it that we love the most. If you're a fan of Lappert's ice cream you'll be pleased to know it can be found here! They will make ice cream sandwiches with any of the cookies in the case. \\n\\nFairy and Cinnamon Rolls ($2.50 each or $20 a dozen) - These are made with croissant dough and taste flaky as well delicious! The fairy roll, topped with magic, was good, but the cinnamon roll topped with their scratch made cinnamon frosting is heaven. These sell out by noon most days. \\n\\nThey now have tables and chairs inside and outside which I like because I've been meeting friends at the Starbucks next door since they have seating outside which is fine, but it's nice to know we can sit at the bakery also now. Inside is clean, the floor awesomely glitters (seriously!), there's a disco ball hanging from the roof and thought was even put into the bathroom. Cool bakery!</th>\n",

       "      <th>I have been by Reef Dispensaries several times and I'm not very impressed. Torn honestly on 2 or 3 stars. When you walk in they have a line for medical as well recreational or you can go back to the budtender room, which I recommend. The reason I recommend going to the budtender room is because at least then you can see and smell the flower instead of just ordering from the menu. The people working as well the security have always been friendly, but I haven't been impressed with their recommendations on flower. The main problem for me is price, taste and quality. Those 3 things are super important. It's hard for me to understand why so many items on the menu are pricier than places on the strip?! It also seems like it's not the right amount in the jar sometimes and why the heck is there no seal on some of the jars? Every other place I go to gives me product that's sealed. Then there's the taste and quality. I have had flower that smokes real nice from here and looks beautiful and some that just hasn't. The Tryke brand I have purchased here has had seeds in it many times which is absolutely not cool. I have also gotten home and not had what I actually ordered in my bag, but instead some other strain that I didn't ask for. While sometimes the strain has been decent, it's made me have to ask them to show me what they are putting in the bag just so I can make sure it's what I wanted. After experiencing other places in town I can't say I am eager to come back here to Reef. It's fair to mention that they did offer a free pre-roll on my birthday, so don't forget to ask about any birthday deals if you do stop in and they do have a rewards program where you earn credit for each purchase that can eventually be used towards your future purchases.</th>\n",

When I got to the register, the shorts didn't ring in as their clearance price, instead they were $22. I brought that to the cashier's attention and he called his manager over. The manager Meredith Moore told me that they had been marked wrong and that we wouldn't get that price for two of them, but the navy pair would be $2.97.   So even though their clearance price was on the tag, they would not honor their price. I work in retail and when we put the wrong price on something and a customer brings it to the counter, we honor that price and take the tags off anything else of that same thing that's the same wrong price. Needless to say, I did not get the $22 shorts. Meredith's customer service was terrible and left me mad for hours.
